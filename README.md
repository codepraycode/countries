# Countries

![Design preview for the REST Countries API with color theme switcher coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Overview
A simple site that lists all the countries of the world and displays brief information about them. It was a challenge from [Frontend mentor](https://frontendmentor.io)

## The challenge

The challenge was to integrate with the [REST Countries API](https://restcountries.com) to pull country data and display it like in the designs.

This was built with Typescript, React and Vitejs.

As a user, you can:

- See all countries from the API on the homepage
- Search for a country using an `input` field
- Filter countries by region
- Click on a country to see more detailed information on a separate page
- Click through to the border countries on the detail page
- Toggle the color scheme between light and dark mode

# It's free

Feel free to fork this repo, or use the functions to pull countries information, which you can use in your app/site, for example, un dropdown for country input.
